Various statistical methods and analytics were applied to the "auto" dataset (a dataset containing various features that define different
car makes). Some of the activities carried out are:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Dynamic in a lot of cases),
- Simple Linear Regression,
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA),
- Logistic Regression,
- K-Nearest Neighbors.

Conclusions drawn from the activities above are documented in the notebook.
